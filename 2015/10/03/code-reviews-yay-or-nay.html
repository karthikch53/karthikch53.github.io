<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">"<i><b>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities,&nbsp;</b></i><br /><i><b>the resources available, and the situation at hand.</b></i>"<br />--Norm Kerth, Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Reviews<br /><br /><b><u>Disclaimer</u></b>: I will try to document my observations. Now, be warned, I may be entirely wrong and there is a fair possibility that it might not make ANY SENSE AT ALL.<br />But I am open to a discussion.<br /><br />Having worked in a few Agile/Kanban/Hybrid/&lt;insert_any_fancy_software_development_methodology_jargon&gt; projects over the past few years, I have always had mixed feelings towards ‘Code Review’.<br /><br />- As much as I have found code reviews a useful exercise, I have felt annoyed when a completed feature sat in code review status just because the reviewer didn’t have the time.<br /><br />- Of all the encounters, this one grabs the cake. In one of my projects, the usual ritual was to include a distribution list with every pull request.<br />Now, usually, nobody would bother except the team which had a direct impact. But once in a while people would pop in (not knowing the context) and raise mindnumbingly insane questions often leading others to digress resulting in a ever growing mail chain heading nowhere.<br />That was a royal pain in the you-know-where. I can’t stress this enough. <br /><br />- There were instances, where I was offended reading the comments. This one is an example.<br /><br />&nbsp;Man! I felt so ashamed that I wanted to wipe out the trail. I wanted this piece of check-in to be removed from the code (I swear to God. I did think about rewriting Git history.<br />But better sense prevailed. ) Slowly, it dawned to me that, the reviewer was critiquing the code and not the person who wrote it.<br />The reviewer would have said the same thing, had someone from his team had done it.<br /><br />Reviewers won’t say a word if the author and the reviewer worked in same teams - MYTH BUSTED. No! It isn’t the case. <br /><br /><!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><br /><div style="background: #ffffff; border-width: .1em .1em .1em .8em; border: solid gray; overflow: auto; padding: .2em .6em; width: auto;"><pre style="line-height: 125%; margin: 0;"><span style="color: #555555; font-weight: bold;">@Path</span><span style="color: #333333;">(</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0;">"/email"</span><span style="color: #333333;">)</span><br /><span style="color: #555555; font-weight: bold;">@POST</span><br /><span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #333399; font-weight: bold;">void</span> <span style="color: #0066bb; font-weight: bold;">sendMessage</span><span style="color: #333333;">(</span><span style="color: #555555; font-weight: bold;">@QueryParam</span> <span style="color: #333333;">(</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0;">"validate"</span><span style="color: #333333;">)</span> <span style="color: #555555; font-weight: bold;">@DefaultValue</span><span style="color: #333333;">(</span><span style="background-color: #fff0f0;">"true"</span><span style="color: #333333;">)</span> String validationRequired<span style="color: #333333;">,</span> String jsonInput<span style="color: #333333;">)</span> <span style="color: #333333;">{</span><br /><span style="color: #888888;">// TODO: Why are we parsing the input argument as a json string?

And how do we fix the gap? Add enough unit/integration/system tests to verify if things are working as expected.<br />- To drag the developer through the mud - we (the team is) are not here to spew hatred/frame opinions. The thing that gets reviewed is the code, and not the developer.<br />It’s solely up to the developer to learn from his/her mistakes.<br />- Is not a safety net - It doesn’t necessarily guarantee that you always have a few people to cover up for your mistakes. The liberty of one last check before it reaches production.<br />At the end of the day, you are responsible for the feature.<br /><br /><b><u>Code review is (the way I see it)</u></b>:<br />- A forum to discuss design decisions, raise questions and get them answered.<br />- A forum where you make yourself publicly accountable. You write a word the whole world notices. Ok! I am exaggerating. But you get the point right. Ensure that you have enough info<br />before you offer your opinion. When in doubt DONT. It’s ok to not know things once. &nbsp;:)<br />- Compliment, reinforce, share good practices.<br />- Detect any slightest deviation which when unnoticed might change the way things are developed.<br /><br />What do I look for when I review the code. (<b><u>Note</u></b>: Truth be told, I haven’t checked for these things meticulously on all occasions.)<br /><br />1. Does the code meet the functional requirement?<br />2. Are there tests for the written code?<br />3. Is there an impact to the existing system?<br />4. Is the code consistent? Naming packages, methods, variable names etc<br />5. Does the code handle exceptions properly? Return codes, error messages<br />6. Can this be reused?<br />7. Is the logic straightforward?<br />8. Readability and maintenance. Logical flow, comments<br />9. Is the code optimized?<br />10. Is the code thread safe? (wherever applicable)<br /><br /><b><u>How developers can help</u></b><br />1. Ensure that the feature meets the functional requirement. If it’s a bug, ensure that it’s fixed.<br />2. Ensure that you add a brief description of the change. It needn’t be full blown. An abridged version of release notes would be perfect.<br />3. The testing strategy you’d followed. If it’s an endpoint, the URLs with the request/response would help.<br />4. Raise pull requests frequently so that we don’t have too much to review.<br />5. Annotate the code properly. Leave enough comments so that it helps others who read the code.<br /><br />Thoughts?<br /><br />PS: I wrote this to educate the the junior developers in my team about code reviews. You might have heard the same thing in many different ways. &nbsp;:)&nbsp;</div>
