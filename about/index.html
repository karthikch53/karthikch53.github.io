Hello! ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I am Karthick. I am a backend developer. I currently live and work in the Bay Area. 
My interests are: Programming Languages, Distributed Systems, GraphQL, NLP, and Virtualization. 
<br />
Over the last few years, the way I consume information has changed. I used to be a Books<em>-only</em> person. Now I prefer Videos, Podcasts, and working code more than Books and Blogs.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve had a few different blogs on different platforms over the years. Every so often, I change things. After several iterations, I have chosen Github pages. Iâ€™ve picked up blogging again hoping to document my learnings and hopefully share something useful with the world. 
<br />
Hereâ€™s a list of Podcasts I listen to - <a href="https://lists.pocketcasts.com/9dfbde5a-45aa-4f23-8b6e-0a23654e956b">link</a></p>

My email is karthikch53 [at] gmail [dot] com</p>
